            I was born in Jun. 1992, at a beautiful city of Harbin, which is famous for its ice and snow culture. And I went to primary
            school from Sept. 1998 to Jul. 2003, possibly after one-year preschool education, which I cannot remember clearly.
            Then I went to junior middle school from Sept. 2003 to Jul. 2007 and senior middle school from Sept. 2007 to
            Jul. 2010. During the last year of my senior middle school, I was the monitor of my class, which still remains
            the most powerful position that I have ever taken up. With a good grade in the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Higher_Education_Entrance_Examination" target="_blank">NCEE</a>, I went to Peking University to learn computer science, first as an undergraduate student, from Sept.
            2010 to Jul. 2014, and now as a Ph.D. candidate, from Sept. 2014 to Jul. 2019 (estimated). From Oct. 2017, I
            went to UCLA as a visiting student, and plan to return to Peking University at Sept. 2018. My Ph.D. career is
            quite smooth, and I have already completed my dissertation proposal. It seems better if there is a table, so
            there is a table!
